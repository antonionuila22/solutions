        question: "How much does a website cost with Codebrand?",
        answer: "Our websites start at $2,500 for a professional 5-page site. E-commerce and custom platforms range from $5,000-$25,000 depending on complexity. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific needs—no hidden fees.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: "A standard business website takes 4-6 weeks. E-commerce sites take 6-10 weeks. Custom web applications vary based on complexity. We set clear milestones and deliver on schedule.",
    },
    {
        question: "What technologies do you use and why?",
        answer: "We use Astro, React, and Next.js for fast, modern websites. For e-commerce, we customize WooCommerce or build headless solutions. For simpler sites, WordPress works great. We choose based on your needs—not trends.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is Codebrand good for small businesses?",
        answer: "Yes. Most of our clients are small to medium businesses looking to grow. We've helped local service providers, e-commerce stores, and startups build professional websites that actually convert visitors into customers.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is Codebrand different from hiring a freelancer?",
        answer: "With us, you get a full team: designers, developers, and project management. No single point of failure. We also provide ongoing support, clear contracts, and accountability. Freelancers are great for small tasks; we handle complete projects.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with clients outside Honduras?",
        answer: "Yes. We work with clients across the US, Latin America, and Spain. We're in the Central timezone (CST), so we overlap with US business hours. Our team is fully bilingual (English/Spanish).",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after my website launches?",
        answer: "Every project includes 30-90 days of post-launch support for bug fixes and adjustments. We also offer monthly maintenance plans for ongoing updates, security, and improvements. Your website shouldn't be abandoned after launch.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I own my website and code?",
        answer: "Yes, 100%. You own everything: domain, hosting account, design files, and source code. We don't lock you in. If you want to leave, you take everything with you.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help with SEO and marketing?",
        answer: "Yes. We build websites with SEO best practices from day one. We also offer ongoing SEO services, content strategy, and can integrate with your marketing tools (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, CRMs).",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get started?",
        answer: "Contact us through the form or WhatsApp. We'll schedule a quick call to understand your project, then send you a detailed proposal with scope, timeline, and pricing. No commitment until you're ready.",
    },
