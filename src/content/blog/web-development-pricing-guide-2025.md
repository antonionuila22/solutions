## Part 10: How to Get the Best Value

### Do's

1. **Get 3-5 quotes** for comparison
2. **Compare apples to apples** - Ensure quotes cover same scope
3. **Ask about what's NOT included**
4. **Check references** before signing
5. **Start with clear requirements**
6. **Consider total cost of ownership** (ongoing + initial)

### Don'ts

1. **Don't choose cheapest option automatically** - Quality matters
2. **Don't pay 100% upfront** - Standard is 30-50% deposit
3. **Don't skip the contract** - Get everything in writing
4. **Don't assume features are included** - Ask explicitly
5. **Don't ignore communication quality** - If they're slow now, imagine during the project

### Best Value Strategies

**For tight budgets:**
- Consider nearshore agencies (same quality, lower cost)
- Start with MVP, expand later
- Use proven platforms (Shopify, WordPress) instead of custom
- Prioritize features ruthlessly

**For mid-range budgets:**
- Balance custom and pre-built components
- Invest in UX design (saves development time)
- Plan for maintenance from the start

**For larger budgets:**
- Invest in proper discovery and planning
- Don't rush - quality takes time
- Budget for ongoing optimization
