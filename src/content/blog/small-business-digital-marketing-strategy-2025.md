## Part 1: Foundation First

### Your Website is Your Home Base

**Non-Negotiable Website Requirements:**

1. **Mobile-Responsive** (60%+ of traffic is mobile)
2. **Fast Loading** (<3 seconds)
3. **Clear Value Proposition** (visitors understand what you do in 5 seconds)
4. **Easy Contact Methods** (phone, form, chat)
5. **Trust Signals** (reviews, testimonials, certifications)
6. **SSL Certificate** (https://)
7. **Google Analytics** installed

**Website Conversion Checklist:**

- [ ] Phone number visible on every page
- [ ] Contact form above the fold on key pages

### Google Business Profile (Critical for Local)

If you serve local customers, this is non-negotiable:

1. **Claim and verify** your Google Business Profile
2. **Complete every field** - businesses with complete profiles get 7x more clicks
3. **Add photos** - businesses with photos get 42% more direction requests
4. **Post weekly** - shows Google you're active
5. **Respond to all reviews** - good and bad
6. **Keep hours updated** - especially holidays

## Part 2: SEO Strategy (Organic Traffic)

### SEO for Small Business: The 80/20 Approach

You don't need to be an SEO expert. Focus on these high-impact activities:

**1. Keyword Research (2-3 hours setup)**

Find what your customers are searching for:

Free tools:
- Google Keyword Planner
- AnswerThePublic
- Google's "People Also Ask"
- Google Autocomplete

**Focus on:**
- Service + Location ("plumber in Miami")
- Problem + Solution ("how to fix leaky faucet")
- Comparison ("best plumber near me")

**Create a keyword map:**

| Page | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Homepage | [service] [city] | [variations] |
| Service 1 | [specific service] | [related terms] |
| Service 2 | [specific service] | [related terms] |
| Location page | [service] in [neighborhood] | [local terms] |

**2. On-Page SEO (Do once per page)**

For each important page:

- [ ] Primary keyword in title tag (front-loaded)
- [ ] Primary keyword in H1
- [ ] Keywords naturally in first 100 words
- [ ] Internal links to related pages
- [ ] External links to authoritative sources
- [ ] Alt text on all images
- [ ] Meta description with keyword and CTA

**3. Local SEO (Critical for local businesses)**

Build local citations (business listings):
1. Google Business Profile
2. Yelp
3. Facebook Business
4. Apple Maps
5. Bing Places
6. Industry-specific directories

**Ensure NAP consistency:**
- **N**ame: Exactly the same everywhere
- **A**ddress: Same format everywhere
- **P**hone: Same number everywhere

**Get reviews:**
- Ask every happy customer
- Make it easy (send direct link)
- Respond to all reviews
- Never buy fake reviews

**4. Content SEO (Ongoing)**

Create content that answers customer questions:

**Content ideas:**
- "How much does [service] cost?"
- "How to choose a [service provider]"
- "[Service] vs [Alternative]"
- "Signs you need [service]"
- "What to expect from [service]"

**Content format:**
- 1,500+ words for comprehensive guides
- 800-1,200 words for service pages
- Include images, lists, tables
- Update annually

## Part 3: Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection (Don't Try to Be Everywhere)

**Choose based on your business:**

| Wed | Customer testimonial | FB/IG | Trust |
| Thu | Industry news | LinkedIn | Authority |
