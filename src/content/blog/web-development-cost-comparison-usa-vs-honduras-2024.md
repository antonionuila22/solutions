## Web Development Cost Comparison: The Truth About USA vs Honduras Pricing

If you've ever gotten a quote for web development in the USA, you've probably experienced sticker shock: **$15,000 for a basic e-commerce site?** **$50,000 for a mobile app?** **$100,000+ for a custom platform?**

Here's what most business owners don't know: **You can get the exact same quality for 60% less** by working with certified development teams in Honduras.

Before you dismiss this as "you get what you pay for," consider this: **Honduras developers use the same technologies, follow the same best practices, and hold the same certifications** (Udemy, Platzi, AWS, Adobe) as US developers. The difference? **Lower cost of living = lower rates**, not lower quality.

In this comprehensive pricing guide, we'll break down **real costs** for every type of [web development](/web-development) project—comparing USA rates with Honduras rates—so you can make an informed decision.
