## Option 1: Big US Agencies

| Pricing | "Competitive rates" | $15,000-$100,000+ for basic projects |
| Attention | "Dedicated team" | Junior staff on your project, seniors on sales |
| Communication | "Always available" | Account managers as middlemen |
| Timeline | "Efficient delivery" | Bloated timelines with overhead |
| Technology | "Cutting-edge" | Often outdated (still pushing WordPress) |

### Typical Costs
- Simple website: $15,000 - $40,000
- E-commerce: $30,000 - $100,000
- Web application: $50,000 - $250,000+

### When to Choose

- You have 6-12 months to wait

---

## Option 2: Cheap Offshore Agencies

| Price | "$500 websites!" | $500 quality |
| Quality | "Professional work" | Template-based, generic designs |
| Communication | "English-speaking" | Timezone gaps, language barriers |

| Ownership | "Your project" | Often locked into their systems |

### Hidden Costs

## What Our Clients Say

### From a Client Who Left a US Agency

> "We paid $45,000 for a website from a 'top' US agency. It took 8 months and looked like a template. Codebrand rebuilt it in 6 weeks for $12,000—and the design is infinitely better. Wish we'd found them first."
> — **Brian T., SaaS Founder**

### From a Client Who Tried Offshore

> "After two failed projects with offshore teams, we were skeptical of anyone overseas. Codebrand changed that completely. Same timezone, perfect English, incredible quality. It's not even comparable."
> — **Lisa M., E-commerce Director**

### From a Client Who Outgrew Their Freelancer

> "Our freelancer was great until he got busy and our project stalled for months. With Codebrand, we get a full team that's always available. It's worth every penny."
> — **Jason K., Startup CEO**
