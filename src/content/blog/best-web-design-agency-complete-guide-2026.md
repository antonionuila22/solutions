## The State of Web Design in 2026

The bar for web design has never been higher:

## Red Flags: Agencies to Avoid

### 1. Template-Based Design
**The claim:** "We'll customize this template for you."
**The reality:** Generic design that looks like thousands of other sites.
**Codebrand approach:** 100% custom design. No templates, ever.

### 2. No Discovery Process
**The claim:** "Send us your content and we'll design."
**The reality:** Design without strategy is decoration, not communication.
**Codebrand approach:** Thorough discovery before any design begins.

### 3. "We Do Everything"
**The claim:** "We're experts in web, mobile, print, video, AR, VR..."
**The reality:** Jack of all trades, master of none.
**Codebrand approach:** We focus on web design and development—and we're the best at it.

### 4. Ultra-Cheap Pricing
**The claim:** "Complete website for $500!"
**The reality:** You get $500 quality. Templates, stock images, no strategy.
**Codebrand approach:** Fair pricing for premium work. You get what you pay for—with us, you get excellence.

### 5. No Portfolio or Vague Portfolio
**The claim:** "We've done lots of projects."
**The reality:** If they can't show it, they probably can't do it.
**Codebrand approach:** 500+ projects in our portfolio, with measurable results.

### 6. Poor Communication
**The claim:** "We'll get back to you soon."
**The reality:** Days or weeks of silence.
**Codebrand approach:** Same-day responses. Weekly updates. No ghosting.
