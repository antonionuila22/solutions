## Who is Zeed Agency?

**[Zeed Agency](https://app.funnelup.io/v2/preview/d1XcvAs6jcOiEc3G7eUS?notrack=true)** is a performance-driven digital marketing agency specializing in **service exportation**—delivering world-class marketing solutions remotely to clients across Latin America, the United States, and beyond. Their model is built for the modern digital economy: you provide the raw content, and they transform it into high-converting campaigns, stunning designs, and strategic assets that drive real business results.

### Core Services

**Digital 360° Performance**: Data-driven growth across Meta (Facebook & Instagram), Google Ads, and multi-channel campaigns. They leverage advanced tracking, conversion APIs, CRM integration, and continuous optimization to deliver measurable outcomes—lower acquisition costs and consistent revenue generation.

**Creative Strategy & Digital Content**: High-impact creative that drives performance, not just aesthetics. From conceptual development to storytelling and content architecture, they craft digital-first ideas that capture attention and convert. Their work includes video editing, motion graphics, social media assets, and AI-enhanced visuals—all designed to strengthen your brand across every platform.

**High-Ticket Lead Generation Systems**: Proven systems to attract, qualify, and convert premium clients. They design end-to-end acquisition funnels using landing pages, automation flows, WhatsApp bots, CRM integrations, and advanced audience modeling. Ideal for real estate, corporate services, medical practices, and high-value industries that require precision and consistency in their sales pipeline.

### How Their Remote Model Works

[Zeed Agency](https://app.funnelup.io/v2/preview/d1XcvAs6jcOiEc3G7eUS?notrack=true) operates on a **content-in, results-out** model:

1. **You provide the raw material**: Videos, photos, testimonials, product shots—any content that requires on-site recording
2. **They handle everything else remotely**: Video editing, graphic design, campaign strategy, ad creative, copywriting, funnel building, automation setup, and ongoing optimization
3. **You get professional, conversion-focused assets**: Ready to deploy across all digital channels

This model allows them to serve clients anywhere in the world while maintaining the quality and strategic depth of a full-service agency. Whether you're in Honduras, Mexico, the US, or Spain—if it can be done remotely, Zeed delivers.

### What Makes Zeed Agency Stand Out

**Performance-First Mindset**: Every creative decision is rooted in data and conversion strategy. They don't just make things look good—they make things that sell.

**Specialized in High-Ticket Markets**: Their expertise lies in industries where each lead matters: real estate, medical services, legal firms, corporate consulting, and premium B2B services.

**Full Remote Capability**: Everything that can be executed digitally—design, editing, campaigns, automation, strategy—they handle with precision. You focus on your business; they focus on your growth.

**Agile & Results-Oriented**: Fast turnaround times, clear communication, and a relentless focus on ROI. They treat your marketing budget like their own money.

**End-to-End Solutions**: Whether you need a complete rebrand with a new website, a digital marketing campaign with cohesive visual assets, or an e-commerce platform with stunning product photography and graphics—we've got you covered.

## Real-World Impact

Imagine you're a real estate developer launching a new project. In the old model, you'd hire a web developer for a landing page, a video editor for your property tours, a designer for social media assets, a marketing agency for ads, and somehow try to coordinate all of them while running your business.

**With the Codebrand-Zeed Agency alliance**, you have one unified team. Here's how it works:

1. **You record**: Property walkthroughs, drone footage, client testimonials—raw content from your phone or camera
2. **Zeed transforms**: Professional video editing, motion graphics, ad creatives, social reels, and WhatsApp sequences
3. **Codebrand builds**: High-converting landing pages, lead capture forms, CRM integrations, and tracking systems
4. **Zeed launches**: Meta Ads campaigns, audience targeting, retargeting funnels, and continuous optimization
5. **You receive**: Qualified leads directly in your WhatsApp or CRM, ready to close

The result? A complete digital acquisition system without the complexity of managing multiple vendors. You focus on selling properties; we focus on filling your pipeline.
