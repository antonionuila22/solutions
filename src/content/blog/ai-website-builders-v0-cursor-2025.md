**Example Prompt That Works:**
```
Build a SaaS landing page with:
- Hero section with gradient background

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI builders are powerful tools** - 3.5M users on V0 alone
2. **They're not replacements** - Complex projects need professionals
3. **Use them for prototyping** - Validate ideas quickly and cheaply
4. **Hybrid approach wins** - AI accelerates, humans ensure quality
5. **Know the limitations** - Security, SEO, accessibility need experts
6. **Cost isn't just initial** - Maintenance and optimization matter

---

## Conclusion

AI website builders have transformed what's possible in 2025. You can go from idea to deployed prototype in minutes. That's remarkable.

But "deployed prototype" isn't "successful business website." The gap between them includes SEO optimization, security hardening, accessibility compliance, performance tuning, and ongoing maintenance—all areas where AI still falls short.

Use AI builders to move faster. Use professionals to move right.
