## 5 design mistakes that make your website look cheap

Your website is often the first impression a customer has of your brand. If it looks careless, unprofessional or outdated, it doesn't matter how good your product is: you'll be losing credibility instantly. In this article we show you the 5 most common design mistakes that make a website look cheap â€” and how to avoid them.

## 1. Excessive use of bright or poorly matched colors

Improper use of color is one of the most visible mistakes. Loud colors, poorly contrasting combinations, or a meaningless rainbow can make your site look amateur.

**How to avoid it:**
Use a coherent and limited color palette (3 to 4 main tones). Rely on tools like Coolors or Adobe Color to select professional combinations.

## 2. Poorly legible or outdated typography

Cursive, overly decorative, or hard-to-read fonts on mobile devices give a sense of carelessness or lack of experience.

**How to avoid it:**
Opt for modern, clean, and legible typography like Inter, Poppins, or Lato. Make sure to maintain clear hierarchies between titles, subtitles, and paragraphs.

## 3. Poor visual structure and clutter

A website without margins, with crowded text blocks or without white space is visually tiring and looks improvised.

**How to avoid it:**
Use a clear visual grid, respect spaces, and maintain a logical navigation flow. White space is an ally, not an enemy.

## 4. Low-quality images or lack of visual coherence

Pixelated, generic photos or those unrelated to your brand are a big "no". They damage the perception of quality instantly.

**How to avoid it:**
Invest in professional images or quality visual banks (like Unsplash or Pexels). Maintain a consistent aesthetic across all pages.

## 5. Lack of consistency between sections

Designs that change drastically from one section to another â€”without justificationâ€” confuse the user and reduce trust.

**How to avoid it:**
Define a design system: button styles, text sizes, icons, spacing. Repeat visual patterns to convey professionalism.

## Conclusion

A professional design doesn't require huge budgets, but it does require attention to detail. Avoiding these common mistakes can make the difference between a site that builds trust and one that drives users away. Remember: your website is your digital storefront. Don't let it look rushed.
