## What is Nearshore Software Development?

**Nearshore software development** is the practice of outsourcing software development to companies in nearby countries—typically within the same or adjacent timezones. For US businesses, this means partnering with development teams in Latin America, particularly countries like Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia.

### Nearshore vs. Offshore vs. Onshore: The Key Differences

| Factor | **Nearshore** (Honduras) | **Offshore** (India, Eastern Europe) | **Onshore** (USA) |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost Savings** | 60-65% | 70-75% | 0% |
| **Timezone Overlap** | 100% (CST) | 0-20% | 100% |
| **Language Barrier** | Minimal (bilingual) | Moderate-High | None |
| **Cultural Alignment** | High | Low-Moderate | High |
| **Travel Time** | 2-3 hours | 15-24 hours | 0-6 hours |
| **Communication** | Real-time | Delayed (12hr diff) | Real-time |
| **Quality** | High | Variable | High |

**The sweet spot**: Nearshore development offers the cost benefits of offshore outsourcing with the communication advantages of onshore teams.

## Why Honduras is the Rising Star of Nearshore Development

While Mexico and Costa Rica have dominated the nearshore market, **Honduras is rapidly emerging as the best-value destination** for US companies. Here's why:
