## The Problem

Zeed is a digital marketing agency specializing in Meta Ads for high-ticket businesses. They had expertise and proven results for their clients (up to 15x revenue growth), but no online presence to showcase their work.

Without a website, they were losing potential clients who couldn't verify their credibility. Their sales process relied entirely on referrals and cold outreach, limiting their growth.

## The Solution

We built a high-converting landing page using Astro and React, designed specifically to turn visitors into booked strategy calls.

**What we implemented:**

- Case studies section with real client results and data
- Transparent pricing table to pre-qualify leads before calls
- Calendly integration for seamless booking
- WhatsApp widget for instant communication
- Trust signals: testimonials, 90-day guarantee, FAQ section
- Dark premium aesthetic matching their high-ticket positioning

**Tech stack:** Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Netlify CDN

## The Result

In the first month after launch:

- **139% traffic growth**
- **0 to 50 daily visitors** with zero paid advertising
- Sub-2-second page load times
- Clear value proposition that communicates within seconds of landing

The website now serves as Zeed's main lead generation tool, attracting coaches, consultants, lawyers, and agencies looking for Meta Ads expertise.
