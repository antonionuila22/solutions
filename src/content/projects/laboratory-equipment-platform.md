## The Problem

Laboratory & Tech is a laboratory and industrial equipment distributor serving Latin America and the US. They needed more than a standard e-commerce site—they needed a B2B platform where clients could request quotes instead of buying directly.

Their challenge: they had thousands of products, an existing CRM they couldn't replace, and needed a way to manage quotes, extract data, and sync everything automatically. Off-the-shelf solutions couldn't handle this complexity.

## The Solution

We built a custom WooCommerce platform from the ground up, transforming it from a traditional store into a B2B quotation system.

**What we built:**

- Custom WooCommerce setup converted into a quote request system (no checkout)
- Custom WordPress plugin built from scratch to integrate with their existing CRM
- Webhooks to extract and sync data automatically between platforms
- Custom API for seamless communication between systems
- Complete UX/UI design for complex B2B navigation
- Full product architecture and categorization system

**What we managed:**

- Uploaded and organized **7,900+ products** across 6 categories
- Multilingual support for international markets
- Mobile-optimized experience for a catalog-heavy site
- Performance optimization for fast loading despite massive inventory

**Tech stack:** WooCommerce, WordPress, Custom PHP Plugin, REST API, Webhooks, CRM Integration

## The Result

Laboratory & Tech now has a fully operational B2B platform that:

- Handles 7,900+ products with fast search and navigation
- Automatically syncs quote requests with their CRM
- Eliminates manual data entry through webhook automation
- Serves clients across Latin America and the US from their Florida base
- Scales as they add more products and expand to new markets

This project required full-stack thinking: from UX research to API architecture to ongoing data management. It's the kind of platform that grows with the business.
