## The Problem

GMJ is a family-owned interior design studio in St. Louis. They had years of experience and a solid portfolio of residential and commercial projects, but no way to show it online.

Their business was limited to local referrals. Potential clients from other states couldn't see their work, couldn't book consultations remotely, and couldn't request estimates without calling directly. They were missing opportunities daily.

## The Solution

We built a clean, professional website that lets GMJ's work speak for itself.

**What we implemented:**

- Portfolio gallery organized by project type (residential, commercial, 3D visualization)
- Online booking system for remote consultations
- Estimate request form with clear next steps
- 4-step design process section to set client expectations
- Mobile-optimized experience for image-heavy content
- Fast loading times despite high-quality project photos

**Tech stack:** Responsive design, booking integration, image optimization, mobile-first approach

## The Result

GMJ now serves clients across the United States, not just St. Louis.

- Remote consultations are now possible through the booking system
- Clients can browse the portfolio and request estimates without calling
- The website communicates their process clearly, reducing back-and-forth questions
- Professional online presence that matches the quality of their design work

For a family-owned studio, having a website that works as a 24/7 sales tool has been transformative for their reach and credibility.
