faqs:
  - question: "How does timezone alignment work with Philadelphia?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time, just 1 hour behind Eastern Time. This means nearly complete overlap with your business day. When you message us at 10 AM, we respond within minutes. When you want a video call at 3 PM, we're available. It's essentially like working with a local team."
  - question: "Do you have experience with healthcare and university websites?"
    answer: "Yes, both are major focuses for us. We've built HIPAA-compliant patient portals, healthcare applications, university websites, and research platforms. We understand the unique requirements of these sectors—accessibility, compliance, and the importance of clear information architecture."
  - question: "Can you integrate with existing systems used by Philadelphia enterprises?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly integrate with Salesforce, Epic (for healthcare), Workday, and custom enterprise systems. Philadelphia's established institutions often have complex technology stacks, and we're comfortable working within those environments."
  - question: "What about life sciences and pharmaceutical company websites?"
    answer: "We understand the life sciences sector's needs: professional corporate presentation, regulatory considerations, investor relations sections, and research platform integration. We can build sites that meet the industry's high standards for professionalism and accuracy."
  - question: "Do you work with Philadelphia startups?"
    answer: "Yes. Philadelphia's startup ecosystem is growing, especially in University City and the Navy Yard. We help founders build MVPs cost-effectively. Our pricing means your seed funding goes further—build more product before needing to raise additional capital."
  - question: "How do Philadelphia clients typically engage with your team?"
    answer: "Most Philadelphia clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're just 1 hour off from Eastern Time, collaboration is natural and seamless. We use project management tools for clear visibility into progress."
