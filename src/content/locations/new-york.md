longDescription: |
  <p>New York City stands as the undisputed capital of global commerce, finance, media, and culture. In this fiercely competitive market, having a <strong>world-class digital presence</strong> isn't just an advantage—it's a necessity. Whether you're a startup in SoHo, a financial services firm in Midtown, or an established retailer in Brooklyn, your website needs to match the caliber of business that New York demands.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we deliver <strong>NYC-quality web development at significantly lower costs</strong> through our nearshore model. While Manhattan agencies often charge $200-400 per hour, our Honduras-based team provides the same enterprise-grade expertise at a fraction of the price—without sacrificing quality, communication, or timezone alignment.</p>

  <p>The New York business environment moves fast. Deadlines are tight, expectations are high, and there's no room for miscommunication or delays. That's why our model is built around <strong>same-timezone collaboration</strong>. Honduras operates on Central Standard Time, just one hour behind Eastern Time. When you need to hop on a call, make a quick revision, or push an urgent update, we're available during your business hours—not sleeping on the other side of the world.</p>

  <p>We've worked with businesses across all five boroughs and understand the diverse needs of NYC's economy. From <strong>Wall Street fintech platforms</strong> requiring bank-grade security, to <strong>Madison Avenue marketing sites</strong> demanding pixel-perfect design, to <strong>Brooklyn D2C brands</strong> needing conversion-optimized e-commerce—our team has the experience and technical depth to deliver.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Can a nearshore team really match the quality of Manhattan web development agencies?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Many NYC agencies actually outsource development overseas anyway—we're just more transparent about it. Our developers are certified professionals using the same technologies (React, Node.js, AWS) as any top Manhattan firm. The difference? We don't have $200/sq ft office rent built into our rates. Our portfolio speaks for itself—we've delivered enterprise-grade work for demanding US clients."
  - question: "How do you handle the fast pace and tight deadlines typical of NYC business?"
    answer: "We're built for it. Same-timezone collaboration means no waiting overnight for responses. Our team structure allows us to scale quickly for urgent projects. We use modern project management tools (Linear, Slack, Notion) to maintain transparency and speed. Many NYC clients tell us we're actually more responsive than local agencies they've worked with."
  - question: "Do you have experience with high-traffic, enterprise-scale New York websites?"
    answer: "Yes. We build with scalability in mind from day one, using modern architectures that can handle millions of visitors. We're experienced with AWS, Vercel, and cloud infrastructure that powers many of NYC's biggest websites. Whether you're launching to 1,000 or 1,000,000 users, we architect for growth."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing New York-based team or agencies?"
    answer: "We frequently collaborate with NYC-based designers, marketing agencies, and internal teams. We can work from Figma designs, integrate with existing codebases, or augment your in-house developers. Our goal is to be a seamless extension of your team, not a replacement."
  - question: "What about meetings and communication with a remote team?"
    answer: "Being only 1 hour behind EST, we're available for meetings throughout your entire business day—typically 9 AM to 7 PM Eastern. We use Zoom for video calls, Slack for daily communication, and can accommodate early morning or evening calls when needed. Most clients do a weekly video sync plus daily Slack updates."
  - question: "How do you ensure security for sensitive NYC financial and legal projects?"
    answer: "We follow industry security best practices including encrypted communications, secure code repositories, NDA agreements, and can sign BAAs for HIPAA projects. We're experienced with SOC 2 compliance requirements and PCI-DSS for payment processing. Your intellectual property and data security are paramount."
