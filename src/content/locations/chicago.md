faqs:
  - question: "How does same-timezone collaboration work with your Honduras team?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time (CST)—identical to Chicago's timezone. This means when you start work at 9 AM, so do we. You can call us anytime during business hours, get same-day responses on Slack, and schedule meetings without timezone math. It's the most significant advantage of nearshore over offshore development."
  - question: "Do you have experience with B2B and manufacturing websites?"
    answer: "Yes, B2B is a core focus for us. We've built product catalogs, dealer/distributor portals, quote request systems, and complex integrations with ERP systems. We understand that B2B sites need to generate leads and serve existing customers—not just look pretty."
  - question: "Can you integrate with our existing business systems?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly integrate websites with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), ERPs (SAP, NetSuite), inventory systems, and custom databases. Our developers are experienced with APIs and data integration—essential for Chicago's enterprise clients."
  - question: "What about security for financial and healthcare clients?"
    answer: "We build with security as a priority. For healthcare clients, we're experienced with HIPAA compliance requirements. For financial services, we follow industry security standards including encryption, secure authentication, and PCI-DSS for payments. We can sign NDAs, BAAs, and other agreements as needed."
  - question: "How do Chicago clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most Chicago clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video check-ins. Because we're in the same timezone, it feels like working with an in-house team. We use project management tools (Linear, Jira) so you always know exactly where your project stands."
  - question: "Do you offer ongoing maintenance and support?"
    answer: "Yes. Many Chicago clients transition to monthly retainers after launch for updates, security patches, performance monitoring, and new feature development. We become a long-term technology partner, not just a one-time vendor."
