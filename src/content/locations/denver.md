faqs:
  - question: "How close is the timezone alignment with Denver?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time, just 1 hour ahead of Mountain Time. This means nearly complete overlap with your business day. You can reach us from 8 AM to 6 PM Mountain Time. Many Denver clients find this virtually indistinguishable from working with a local team in terms of communication."
  - question: "Do you work with outdoor and recreation industry companies?"
    answer: "Yes, and we love these projects. We've built e-commerce platforms, brand websites, and community applications for outdoor brands. We understand the industry's aesthetic standards and the importance of showcasing products in inspiring ways. Colorado's outdoor industry is a natural fit for our team."
  - question: "Can you help Boulder startups build MVPs quickly?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Speed is critical for startups, and we deliver. We've helped founders go from concept to launched MVP in weeks. Our cost structure means your seed funding stretches further—build more product before needing to raise additional capital. Many Boulder startups find our pricing a significant advantage."
  - question: "What about cannabis industry compliance requirements?"
    answer: "We're familiar with the unique requirements of cannabis tech, including compliance tracking, inventory management, and e-commerce restrictions. We can build platforms that meet Colorado's regulatory requirements while providing a great user experience for customers."
  - question: "Do you work with established Denver companies or just startups?"
    answer: "Both. We work with early-stage startups, growth-stage companies, and established enterprises. For larger companies, we can augment existing teams or take on specific projects. Our flexible engagement models fit different organizational needs and budgets."
  - question: "How do Denver clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most Denver clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're only 1 hour off from Mountain Time, collaboration is natural and efficient. We use project management tools so you always have clear visibility into progress."
