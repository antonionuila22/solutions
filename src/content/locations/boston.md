faqs:
  - question: "Do you have experience with healthcare and HIPAA compliance?"
    answer: "Yes, healthcare is a significant focus for us. We've built HIPAA-compliant patient portals, appointment systems, and healthcare applications. We understand the security requirements—encryption, access controls, audit logging—and can sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) when required."
  - question: "Can you build platforms for research and academic institutions?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We've worked on research data platforms, academic websites, and institutional applications. We understand the unique needs of universities—accessibility requirements, integration with institutional systems, and the importance of presenting complex information clearly."
  - question: "How do you handle the timezone difference with Boston?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Standard Time, just 1 hour behind Eastern Time. This means we overlap with your entire business day. You can call us at 9 AM, 2 PM, or 5 PM Eastern—we're available. Most Boston clients find this virtually indistinguishable from working with a local team."
  - question: "What about working with Boston's biotech and life sciences companies?"
    answer: "We're experienced with the biotech sector's needs: data visualization dashboards, secure research platforms, regulatory compliance considerations, and integration with scientific tools. Our developers can work with complex datasets and create interfaces that help researchers do their work more effectively."
  - question: "Do you work with early-stage startups in Cambridge?"
    answer: "Yes. We help startups go from idea to MVP cost-effectively. Cambridge founders often have limited runway, and our pricing means your seed funding goes further. We've helped startups build, launch, and iterate—and several have gone on to raise significant Series A rounds."
  - question: "Can you integrate with enterprise systems common in Boston businesses?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly integrate with Salesforce, SAP, Workday, Epic (for healthcare), and custom enterprise systems. Boston's established companies often have complex technology stacks, and we're comfortable working within those constraints."
