faqs:
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference with Las Vegas?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Time, 2 hours ahead of Pacific. We overlap with your business hours from 7 AM to 5 PM Vegas time. Given that Las Vegas is a 24/7 city, we're also flexible with scheduling for urgent needs. This is far better than offshore teams with 12+ hour gaps."
  - question: "Do you have experience with hospitality and casino websites?"
    answer: "Yes. Las Vegas hospitality is a unique industry with high visual standards and complex booking needs. We've built hotel websites, resort platforms, and entertainment booking systems. We understand the importance of visual impact, mobile optimization, and seamless reservation experiences."
  - question: "Can you build high-traffic websites for conventions and events?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We build with scalability in mind, using modern architectures and cloud hosting that can handle traffic spikes during major conventions and events. Whether you're expecting thousands or hundreds of thousands of visitors, we architect for performance."
  - question: "What about entertainment and ticketing platforms?"
    answer: "We understand the entertainment industry's needs: visually stunning presentation, secure ticketing, mobile-first design, and integration with box office systems. We can build platforms that showcase performers and venues while handling the transactional complexity of ticket sales."
  - question: "Do you work with Downtown Las Vegas tech startups?"
    answer: "Yes. DTLV's tech scene is growing, and we help startups build MVPs cost-effectively. Our pricing means your seed funding goes further. We've helped startups launch, iterate, and scale—working with the same urgency that Vegas businesses expect."
  - question: "How do Las Vegas clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most Las Vegas clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. We use project management tools so you always have clear visibility into progress. We understand that Vegas moves fast, and we match that pace."
