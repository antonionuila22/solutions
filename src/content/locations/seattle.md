longDescription: |
  <p>Seattle—where Amazon, Microsoft, and a thriving ecosystem of tech companies have created one of the world's most innovative technology hubs. In a city that literally <strong>invented cloud computing and transformed e-commerce</strong>, the bar for web development is set extraordinarily high. Your website needs to meet those standards.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we serve Seattle's tech-savvy business community with <strong>Silicon Valley-quality development at more accessible pricing</strong>. While Seattle developers command $150-250/hour (and they're increasingly hard to find), our nearshore team delivers the same technical excellence using the same modern stack—React, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS—at a fraction of the cost.</p>

  <p>We understand Seattle's tech culture. <strong>You need developers who speak cloud-native</strong>, who understand microservices architecture, who can build scalable systems from day one. You need partners who follow modern practices—CI/CD, automated testing, infrastructure as code. That's not optional here; it's expected. Our team delivers exactly that.</p>

  <p>While we're based in Honduras (2 hours ahead of Pacific Time), our workflow aligns with Seattle business hours. We're available for calls from 7 AM to 5 PM your time. We use the same collaboration tools—Slack, GitHub, Linear—that Seattle teams use. And because we're nearshore rather than offshore, you avoid the 12+ hour timezone gaps that make Asian development partnerships challenging.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Can nearshore developers really match Seattle's technical standards?"
    answer: "Yes. Our developers use the same technologies (React, TypeScript, Node.js, AWS) and follow the same practices (code review, CI/CD, testing) as Seattle teams. Many Seattle companies already outsource development—we offer a better alternative than offshore with meaningful timezone overlap and no communication barriers."
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Time, 2 hours ahead of Pacific. We overlap with your business hours from 7 AM to 5 PM Seattle time. Morning standups, afternoon planning sessions, end-of-day demos—we can attend any of them. This is far better than offshore teams with 12-16 hour gaps."
  - question: "Are you experienced with cloud-native development and AWS?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We build cloud-native applications using AWS, GCP, and Azure. We're comfortable with serverless architectures, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and the DevOps practices that Seattle tech companies expect. We can work with your existing cloud infrastructure or architect new solutions."
  - question: "Can you help Seattle startups build MVPs quickly?"
    answer: "Yes. Speed-to-market is critical for startups, and we deliver. We've helped founders go from concept to launched MVP in weeks. Our cost structure means your seed funding goes further—you can build more product before needing to raise additional capital."
  - question: "Do you work with established Seattle tech companies?"
    answer: "Yes. We work with startups, growth-stage companies, and established enterprises. For larger companies, we often augment existing teams or take on specific projects. Our flexible engagement models fit different organizational needs."
  - question: "What about intellectual property and security?"
    answer: "We treat IP protection seriously. We sign NDAs, use secure repositories with proper access controls, and follow security best practices. Your code is your competitive advantage, and we handle it with the same care your internal team would."
