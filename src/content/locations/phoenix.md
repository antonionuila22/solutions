faqs:
  - question: "How close is the timezone alignment with Phoenix?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time, just 1 hour behind Mountain Standard Time. This means nearly complete overlap with your business day. You can reach us from 8 AM to 6 PM Arizona time. Many Phoenix clients find this virtually indistinguishable from working with a local team."
  - question: "Do you have experience with healthcare industry websites?"
    answer: "Yes. Healthcare is a major sector in Phoenix, and we've built HIPAA-compliant patient portals, appointment systems, and healthcare platforms. We understand the security requirements—encryption, access controls, audit logging—and can sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) when required."
  - question: "Can you help Phoenix startups build MVPs?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Arizona's startup ecosystem is growing rapidly, especially around ASU. We help founders go from idea to launched MVP quickly and cost-effectively. Our pricing means your seed funding builds more product before needing to raise additional capital."
  - question: "What about real estate and property tech projects?"
    answer: "Phoenix's real estate market is one of the hottest in the country, and we've built property platforms, MLS integrations, virtual tour systems, and real estate CRMs. We understand the industry's needs for lead generation, property showcase, and broker tools."
  - question: "Do you work with Scottsdale financial services companies?"
    answer: "Yes. We build secure financial platforms, client portals, and fintech applications. We understand compliance requirements, secure data handling, and the professional presentation that financial services clients expect."
  - question: "How do Phoenix clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most Phoenix clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're only 1 hour off from Arizona time, collaboration is natural and efficient. We use project management tools so you always have clear visibility into progress."
