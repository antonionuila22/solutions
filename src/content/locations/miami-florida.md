faqs:
  - question: "Why should Miami businesses choose a nearshore development company over a local Miami agency?"
    answer: "While Miami has excellent local agencies, they typically charge premium rates ($150-250/hour) due to high operational costs. Our nearshore model from Honduras offers identical timezone overlap (CST is just 1 hour behind EST), fluent English communication, and the same quality standards—at 60% lower rates. You get real-time collaboration without the premium Miami price tag."
  - question: "How do you handle communication with Miami clients given you're not physically in Florida?"
    answer: "We work in the same timezone as Miami (Honduras CST is only 1 hour behind EST), which means real-time collaboration during your business hours. We use Slack, Zoom, and project management tools for daily communication. Many of our Miami clients prefer this model because they get faster responses than they did with overseas teams in different timezones."
  - question: "Can you work with Miami-based designers and marketing agencies?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We frequently collaborate with Miami-based creative agencies, marketing firms, and UX designers. We're comfortable receiving Figma designs, Adobe XD files, or working with your existing team to bring designs to life. Our role is to be a seamless extension of your local team."
  - question: "What technologies do you use for Miami web development projects?"
    answer: "We use the same modern stack as top Miami agencies: React, Next.js, Astro, Vue.js for frontends; Node.js, Python, and PHP for backends; Shopify, WooCommerce for e-commerce; and AWS, Vercel, Netlify for hosting. We choose the best technology for each project's specific needs."
  - question: "Do you offer ongoing support and maintenance for Miami businesses?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer flexible maintenance packages including security updates, performance monitoring, content updates, and technical support. Many Miami clients start with a development project and transition to a monthly retainer for ongoing improvements and support."
  - question: "How quickly can you start a web development project for a Miami business?"
    answer: "We can typically begin discovery and planning within 1-2 weeks of signing. For urgent projects, we've started development within days. Our team structure allows us to scale quickly to meet tight Miami business deadlines."
