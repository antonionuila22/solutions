longDescription: |
  <p>Los Angeles—the entertainment capital of the world, a global hub for technology, fashion, and innovation. In a city where <strong>image is everything</strong>, your digital presence needs to be nothing short of exceptional. Whether you're a production company in Hollywood, a tech startup in Silicon Beach, or a fashion brand in the Arts District, your website is often the first impression you make on clients, investors, and customers worldwide.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we help LA businesses create <strong>stunning, high-performance websites</strong> without the typical Hollywood price tag. Our nearshore development model from Honduras delivers the same creative excellence and technical sophistication you'd expect from a Westside agency—at up to 60% lower cost.</p>

  <p>We understand that Los Angeles operates differently. The entertainment industry demands websites that can handle massive traffic spikes during premieres and events. Tech startups need rapid MVP development to stay ahead of competitors. E-commerce brands require conversion-optimized experiences that reflect California's trendsetting aesthetic. Our team has delivered hundreds of projects for US clients and knows how to execute at the level LA businesses expect.</p>

  <p>While we're based in Honduras (just 2 hours ahead of Pacific Time), our workflow is designed for seamless collaboration with LA clients. We're available for calls and real-time collaboration during your business hours. Most projects involve daily Slack updates and weekly video syncs—keeping you in the loop without requiring you to work around a 12-hour timezone difference like with offshore teams in Asia.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference with Los Angeles?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time (CST), which is only 2 hours ahead of Pacific Time. This means we overlap with most of your business day—we can take calls from 7 AM to 5 PM your time. Many LA clients actually prefer this to offshore teams in Asia or Eastern Europe where there's 10-12 hour gaps."
  - question: "Do you have experience with entertainment industry websites?"
    answer: "Yes. We've built websites for content creators, production companies, and entertainment brands. We understand the unique requirements—from high-traffic event pages to media-rich portfolios to sophisticated video streaming integration. Our team is comfortable working with the creative standards Hollywood expects."
  - question: "Can you build e-commerce sites that match LA's aesthetic standards?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We build on platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and custom solutions that can deliver the premium visual experience LA brands demand. We work from Figma designs to ensure pixel-perfect implementation, and we optimize for mobile—crucial given California's mobile-first consumers."
  - question: "What about startup MVPs? Can you work with early-stage LA companies?"
    answer: "Startups are a significant part of our business. We help Silicon Beach founders go from idea to MVP quickly and cost-effectively. Our 60% cost savings means your seed funding goes further. We've helped startups launch, iterate, and scale—several have gone on to raise significant funding."
  - question: "Do you provide ongoing support after launch?"
    answer: "Yes. We offer flexible maintenance packages including updates, security monitoring, performance optimization, and feature additions. Many LA clients start with a build project and transition to monthly retainer for continuous improvements and support."
  - question: "How do you ensure quality when you're not local to Los Angeles?"
    answer: "Quality comes from process, not proximity. We use modern development practices including code reviews, automated testing, and staged deployments. Our project management is transparent—you see progress daily. And our portfolio demonstrates that remote teams can absolutely deliver LA-caliber work."
