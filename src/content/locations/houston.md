longDescription: |
  <p>Houston—the energy capital of the world, a powerhouse in healthcare, aerospace, and international trade. As the fourth-largest city in America and one of the most diverse metros in the nation, Houston businesses operate on a <strong>global scale with Texas-sized ambitions</strong>. Your digital presence needs to match that scope.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we help Houston businesses build <strong>powerful, professional web solutions</strong> without the inflated prices of coastal agencies. Our nearshore development model from Honduras delivers enterprise-quality work at costs that make sense for Houston's practical business culture.</p>

  <p>The best part? <strong>Houston and Honduras operate on the exact same timezone</strong>—Central Standard Time. When your team arrives at the office in the Galleria, Energy Corridor, or Texas Medical Center, our developers are already at their desks ready to collaborate. No timezone delays, no waiting overnight for responses—just seamless, real-time partnership.</p>

  <p>We've built websites and applications for industries that Houston leads: <strong>energy companies needing robust portals</strong>, <strong>healthcare organizations requiring HIPAA compliance</strong>, <strong>manufacturing firms with complex B2B needs</strong>, and <strong>e-commerce businesses serving Houston's diverse consumer market</strong>. Our team understands that Houston businesses value substance, reliability, and getting the job done right.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Why is same-timezone collaboration such a big advantage?"
    answer: "Houston runs on Central Time, and so does Honduras—it's identical. When you have an urgent question at 2 PM, you don't wait until the next day for a response. When you need a video call to discuss requirements, we're available during your entire business day. This is the key difference between nearshore (same timezone) and offshore (Asia/Europe with 8-12 hour gaps)."
  - question: "Do you have experience with energy sector websites?"
    answer: "Yes. We've built corporate sites, investor relations platforms, and operational dashboards for energy companies. We understand the industry's need for professional presentation, secure data handling, and integration with operational systems. Our developers can work with technical requirements specific to oil, gas, and renewable energy."
  - question: "Can you build HIPAA-compliant healthcare applications?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We have experience building healthcare platforms that meet HIPAA requirements including secure data transmission, access controls, audit logging, and proper data storage. We can sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for projects involving protected health information."
  - question: "What technologies do you use for Houston projects?"
    answer: "We use the same modern stack as top Houston agencies: React, Next.js, Vue.js for frontends; Node.js, Python, .NET for backends; PostgreSQL, MongoDB for databases; and AWS, Azure for cloud hosting. We select technologies based on your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and long-term maintenance needs."
  - question: "How do you handle large enterprise projects?"
    answer: "We're experienced with enterprise-scale projects requiring multiple developers, complex integrations, and extensive documentation. We can scale our team to meet project demands, work within formal project management frameworks, and integrate with your existing development or IT teams."
  - question: "Do you support Houston's diverse business community with bilingual needs?"
    answer: "Yes. Our team is fully bilingual in English and Spanish, which is valuable for Houston's international business community. We can build multilingual websites, handle content in both languages, and communicate comfortably with bilingual stakeholders."
