faqs:
  - question: "How does timezone alignment work with Atlanta?"
    answer: "Honduras operates on Central Standard Time, just 1 hour behind Eastern Time. This means nearly complete overlap with your business day. When you message us at 10 AM Eastern, we respond within minutes. When you want a video call at 3 PM, we're available. It's essentially like working with a local team."
  - question: "Do you have experience with fintech and payment platforms?"
    answer: "Yes. Atlanta is the payments capital of America, and we understand the sector's requirements: PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing, secure data handling, robust authentication, and high-availability architectures. We can build fintech applications that meet the security standards the industry demands."
  - question: "Can you work with Atlanta's Fortune 500 companies?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We've built enterprise applications and corporate websites for large organizations. We understand enterprise requirements: security protocols, integration with existing systems, formal project management, and proper documentation. We can work within your IT governance and procurement processes."
  - question: "What about Atlanta's growing startup scene?"
    answer: "We're well-suited for startups. Tech Square and Atlanta's startup community need cost-effective development partners who can move fast. Our pricing means your seed funding goes further. We've helped startups go from concept to launched MVP in weeks, not months."
  - question: "Do you have experience with healthcare applications?"
    answer: "Yes. We build HIPAA-compliant applications including patient portals, appointment systems, and healthcare platforms. We understand the security requirements—encryption, access controls, audit logging—and can sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for projects involving protected health information."
  - question: "How do Atlanta clients typically engage with your team?"
    answer: "Most Atlanta clients do an initial kickoff call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're just 1 hour off from Eastern Time, collaboration is natural and seamless. We use project management tools so you always have clear visibility into progress and can provide feedback in real-time."
