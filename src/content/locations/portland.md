longDescription: |
  <p>Portland—the City of Roses, a hub of <strong>creativity, sustainability, and independent spirit</strong>. Home to Nike, Intel, and a thriving startup ecosystem, Portland combines Pacific Northwest innovation with a unique culture that values authenticity, design, and doing things differently. Your digital presence needs to reflect that distinctive Portland character.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we serve Portland's creative and tech-forward business community with <strong>high-quality web development at accessible rates</strong>. Our nearshore model from Honduras delivers the design-conscious, technically excellent work that Portland businesses expect—without the premium costs of local agencies.</p>

  <p>While we're based in Honduras (2 hours ahead of Pacific Time), our workflow aligns with Portland business hours. We're available for calls from 7 AM to 5 PM your time. We use the same collaboration tools that Portland tech companies use—Slack, GitHub, Figma. And because we're nearshore rather than offshore, you avoid the massive timezone gaps that make Asian partnerships challenging.</p>

  <p>We understand Portland's unique culture. From <strong>outdoor and athletic brands</strong> to <strong>sustainable businesses with values-driven missions</strong>, from <strong>creative agencies in the Pearl District</strong> to <strong>tech startups in the Silicon Forest</strong>—we build websites and applications that honor Portland's commitment to quality, design, and authenticity.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference with Portland?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Time, 2 hours ahead of Pacific. We overlap with your business hours from 7 AM to 5 PM Portland time. Morning standups, afternoon planning sessions, end-of-day reviews—we can attend any of them. This is far better than offshore teams with 12+ hour gaps."
  - question: "Do you work with athletic and outdoor brands?"
    answer: "Yes. Portland is the global capital of athletic footwear and outdoor gear, and we understand the industry's needs: visually stunning e-commerce, product showcases, athlete endorsements, and performance-driven design. We build sites that match the quality expectations of this world-class industry."
  - question: "Can you help Portland startups build MVPs?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Portland's startup scene values efficiency and doing more with less. We help founders go from concept to launched MVP quickly and cost-effectively. Our cost structure means your seed funding stretches further—build more product before needing to raise additional capital."
  - question: "What about sustainable and values-driven businesses?"
    answer: "Portland attracts mission-driven companies, and we're proud to work with them. We can build websites that communicate your sustainability story, showcase your impact, and connect with conscious consumers. Your values matter, and your website should reflect them."
  - question: "Do you have experience with design-focused projects?"
    answer: "Yes. Portland has high design standards, and we meet them. We work closely with designers, execute pixel-perfect implementations from Figma, and understand that in Portland, aesthetics matter as much as functionality. We build beautiful, purposeful websites."
  - question: "How do Portland clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most Portland clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. We use project management tools so you always have clear visibility into progress. Because we're only 2 hours off from Pacific Time, collaboration feels natural."
