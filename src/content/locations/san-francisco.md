longDescription: |
  <p>San Francisco—the global epicenter of technology innovation. In a city where <strong>tech giants were born in garages</strong> and startups raise millions over coffee, the standards for web development are extraordinarily high. Your website isn't just a marketing asset—it's often your product, your platform, and the foundation of your entire business.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we serve San Francisco's demanding tech ecosystem with a unique value proposition: <strong>Silicon Valley-caliber development at significantly reduced rates</strong>. While SF developers command $150-300/hour, our nearshore team delivers the same quality using identical technologies—React, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS—at a fraction of the cost.</p>

  <p>We understand that SF startups and tech companies have specific needs. You need developers who can <strong>ship fast without accumulating technical debt</strong>. You need teams that understand modern practices—CI/CD, automated testing, code review, agile sprints. You need partners who speak your language, literally and technically. Our team is fluent in both English and the latest development methodologies.</p>

  <p>While we're based in Honduras (just 2 hours ahead of Pacific Time), our workflow is optimized for Bay Area clients. We overlap with your business hours for calls and real-time collaboration. Our developers stay current with the technologies and practices that SF companies expect. And because we're nearshore rather than offshore, you avoid the 12+ hour timezone gaps that make working with Asian or European teams challenging.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Can a nearshore team really match SF development standards?"
    answer: "Yes. Our developers use the same technologies (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js), follow the same practices (code review, CI/CD, testing), and deliver the same code quality as SF developers. The difference is location and cost—not capability. Many SF companies already outsource development; we're just a better option than offshore with a 2-hour timezone gap vs 12+ hours."
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference with San Francisco?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Time, 2 hours ahead of Pacific. This means we overlap with your business hours from roughly 7 AM to 5 PM your time. We can do morning standups, afternoon calls, and real-time Slack communication throughout your day. Many SF clients find this preferable to offshore teams where there's zero overlap."
  - question: "What's your experience with startup MVPs and rapid development?"
    answer: "Startups are a core part of our business. We've helped founders go from idea to launched MVP in weeks. We understand that speed matters, runway is precious, and you need to iterate based on user feedback. Our cost structure means your seed funding stretches further—build more, spend less."
  - question: "Do you work with established SF tech companies or just startups?"
    answer: "Both. We work with early-stage startups building their first product, growth-stage companies scaling their platforms, and established tech companies that need to augment their engineering teams cost-effectively. Our flexible engagement models accommodate different needs."
  - question: "What about code quality and technical practices?"
    answer: "We follow modern development practices: Git-based version control, pull request workflows with code review, automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), CI/CD pipelines, and proper documentation. We write clean, maintainable code because we understand that SF companies need to iterate and scale."
  - question: "Can you sign NDAs and handle sensitive intellectual property?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We routinely sign NDAs and confidentiality agreements. We understand that your code is your competitive advantage. We use secure repositories, implement proper access controls, and treat your intellectual property with the same care as your in-house team would."
