longDescription: |
  <p>Austin—the Live Music Capital of the World turned <strong>Silicon Hills</strong>, one of America's fastest-growing tech hubs. As Tesla, Oracle, and hundreds of startups have relocated to Austin, the city has transformed into a magnet for innovation, talent, and venture capital. Your digital presence needs to match Austin's ambitious energy.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we're the perfect partner for Austin's dynamic business community. Our nearshore model delivers <strong>tech hub-quality development at Texas-friendly prices</strong>—the same modern stack used by Austin's hottest startups, without the inflated costs of Silicon Valley transplant agencies.</p>

  <p>Here's what makes our Austin partnership unique: <strong>Honduras operates on the exact same timezone as Austin</strong>—Central Standard Time. When you're starting your day on South Congress or in the Domain, we're starting ours. Real-time collaboration, instant responses, and the ability to hop on a call whenever you need. It's like having a development team down the street, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

  <p>We understand Austin's entrepreneurial culture. <strong>Move fast, iterate quickly, ship great products.</strong> Whether you're a funded startup racing to product-market fit, an established tech company scaling rapidly, or a local business digitizing operations, we deliver with the speed and quality Austin expects.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How does same-timezone collaboration work?"
    answer: "Austin and Honduras are both on Central Standard Time—identical timezone. When you message us at 2 PM, we respond within minutes. When you want a video call, we're available throughout your business day. There's no timezone math, no waiting overnight. It's the most seamless working relationship possible."
  - question: "Are you set up to work with Austin's fast-moving startups?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Startups are a core part of our business. We understand that speed matters, runway is precious, and you need to iterate based on user feedback. We can go from kickoff to MVP in weeks, not months. Our cost structure means your seed funding builds more product."
  - question: "Can you help companies that have relocated to Austin?"
    answer: "Yes. We've worked with companies moving from the Bay Area, New York, and other markets. We understand the transition—you need reliable partners who can execute at the level you're used to. Our technical capabilities match what you'd find in any major tech hub."
  - question: "What technologies do you specialize in for Austin projects?"
    answer: "We use the same modern stack as Austin's top startups: React, Next.js, Vue.js for frontends; Node.js, Python for backends; PostgreSQL, MongoDB for databases; and AWS, Vercel, Netlify for hosting. We choose technologies based on your specific needs and goals."
  - question: "Do you offer ongoing support after launch?"
    answer: "Yes. Many Austin clients transition to monthly retainers for updates, new features, and technical support. We become a long-term development partner, scaling up or down based on your needs. This is especially valuable for startups that don't want to hire full-time developers yet."
  - question: "How do Austin businesses typically engage with your team?"
    answer: "Most Austin clients do an initial kickoff call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're in the same timezone, collaboration is natural and efficient. We use project management tools so you always have visibility into progress."
