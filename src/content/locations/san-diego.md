longDescription: |
  <p>San Diego—America's Finest City, a global leader in biotechnology, defense technology, and tourism. With perfect weather, world-class research institutions, and a thriving innovation economy, San Diego attracts businesses and talent from around the world. Your <strong>digital presence needs to match the quality and innovation</strong> that defines this remarkable city.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we serve San Diego's diverse business community with <strong>premium web development at competitive rates</strong>. Our nearshore model from Honduras delivers the technical excellence that La Jolla biotech firms and Downtown San Diego enterprises expect—without the premium costs of local agencies.</p>

  <p>While we're based in Honduras (2 hours ahead of Pacific Time), our workflow aligns with San Diego business hours. We're available for calls from 7 AM to 5 PM your time. We use the same collaboration tools that San Diego tech companies use—Slack, GitHub, Figma. And because we're nearshore rather than offshore, you avoid the 12+ hour timezone gaps that make Asian partnerships challenging.</p>

  <p>We understand San Diego's unique economy. From <strong>biotech companies in Torrey Pines</strong> to <strong>defense contractors serving the military</strong>, from <strong>tourism and hospitality businesses</strong> to <strong>cross-border commerce with Mexico</strong>—we deliver websites and applications that serve San Diego's distinct industries and bilingual market.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How do you handle the 2-hour timezone difference with San Diego?"
    answer: "Honduras is on Central Time, 2 hours ahead of Pacific. We overlap with your business hours from 7 AM to 5 PM San Diego time. Morning standups, afternoon planning sessions, end-of-day reviews—we can attend any of them. This is far better than offshore teams with 12+ hour gaps."
  - question: "Do you have experience with biotech and life sciences websites?"
    answer: "Yes. San Diego's biotech cluster is world-renowned, and we understand the sector's needs: professional corporate presentation, investor relations sections, research pipeline visualization, and regulatory considerations. We build sites that meet the industry's high standards."
  - question: "Can you build bilingual websites for cross-border businesses?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our team is fully bilingual in English and Spanish, which is perfect for San Diego's cross-border economy. We can build multilingual websites, handle content in both languages, and create seamless experiences for audiences on both sides of the border."
  - question: "What about defense contractor security requirements?"
    answer: "We understand that defense-adjacent work requires strong security practices. We follow industry best practices for secure development, can sign NDAs and security agreements, and build applications with security as a priority. We're comfortable with the documentation and access control requirements these projects demand."
  - question: "Do you work with San Diego tourism and hospitality businesses?"
    answer: "Yes. Tourism is a major San Diego industry, and we've built booking platforms, hotel websites, attraction sites, and restaurant systems. We understand the importance of mobile optimization, visual appeal, and conversion-focused design for hospitality businesses."
  - question: "How do San Diego clients typically work with your team?"
    answer: "Most San Diego clients do a kickoff video call, then daily Slack communication with weekly video syncs. Because we're only 2 hours off from Pacific Time, we can participate in most of your business day. We use project management tools so you always have visibility into progress."
