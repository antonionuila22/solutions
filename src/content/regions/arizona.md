longDescription: |
  <p>Arizona—the Grand Canyon State, one of the fastest-growing states in America and a hub for <strong>technology, healthcare, aerospace, and tourism</strong>. From Phoenix's expanding tech sector to Tucson's research institutions, from Scottsdale's resort industry to the state's aerospace and defense presence, Arizona offers business opportunities in a pro-growth environment.</p>

  <p>At Codebrand, we help Arizona businesses build <strong>professional, effective websites</strong> at competitive rates. Our nearshore team in Honduras brings an additional advantage: a <strong>fully bilingual team</strong> that understands the Southwest's bicultural business environment.</p>

  <p>Communication is easy: <strong>Honduras is just 1 hour behind Mountain Time</strong>. Note that Arizona doesn't observe daylight saving time, so the time difference remains consistent year-round. When you're working in Phoenix, Tucson, or Scottsdale, we're ready to collaborate.</p>

Whether you're a <strong>growing tech company in Phoenix</strong>, a <strong>healthcare organization</strong>, an <strong>aerospace contractor in Tucson</strong>, or a <strong>resort in Scottsdale</strong>—we can help you build websites that effectively serve your customers and support your business goals.</p>
