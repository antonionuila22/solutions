    question: "How much does custom web development cost?",
    answer: "Custom web development costs vary based on project complexity, features, and timeline. A basic business website typically ranges from $3,000-$10,000, while complex web applications or e-commerce platforms can range from $15,000-$50,000+. At Codebrand, we offer competitive pricing with our Honduras-based team, providing premium quality at up to 60% less than US agencies.

  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom website?",
    answer: "Development timelines depend on project scope. A standard business website takes 4-6 weeks, a custom web application 8-12 weeks, and complex e-commerce platforms 10-16 weeks. We use agile methodologies with weekly sprints, so you'll see progress from week one. Rush projects are available for time-sensitive launches."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use for web development?",
    answer: "We specialize in modern, high-performance technologies including React, Next.js, Astro, and Vue.js for frontend development. For backend, we use Node.js, Python, and serverless architectures. Our databases include PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Supabase. We also work with headless CMS platforms like Contentful, Sanity, and Strapi for content management."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide ongoing website maintenance and support?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer comprehensive maintenance packages including security updates, performance monitoring, content updates, bug fixes, and technical support. Our maintenance plans start at $299/month and include priority response times, regular backups, and uptime monitoring. We also offer on-demand support for clients who prefer pay-as-you-go arrangements."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my website be mobile-friendly and SEO-optimized?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Every website we build is mobile-first and fully responsive across all devices. We implement technical SEO best practices including semantic HTML, optimized meta tags, structured data markup, fast loading speeds (under 2 seconds), Core Web Vitals optimization, and accessibility compliance. Our sites consistently score 90+ on Google PageSpeed Insights."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you redesign my existing website without losing SEO rankings?",
    answer: "Yes, website migration and redesign is one of our specialties. We carefully plan URL structures, implement proper 301 redirects, preserve meta data, and maintain your existing SEO equity. We've successfully migrated hundreds of websites while maintaining or improving their search rankings. We also conduct pre and post-migration SEO audits to ensure nothing is lost."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build e-commerce websites?",
    answer: "Yes, we develop full-featured e-commerce platforms using Shopify, WooCommerce, and custom solutions. Our e-commerce sites include secure payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, Square), inventory management, order tracking, customer accounts, and conversion-optimized checkout flows. We've helped businesses increase online sales by an average of 40% after launching with us."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your web development process?",
    answer: "Our process includes four phases: 1) Discovery & Planning - we analyze your business goals, target audience, and technical requirements. 2) Design & Architecture - we create wireframes, UI mockups, and technical specifications. 3) Development & Testing - we build using agile sprints with regular demos and comprehensive QA testing. 4) Launch & Support - we deploy to production and provide ongoing maintenance. You're involved at every step with weekly updates and review sessions."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate third-party services and APIs?",
    answer: "Yes, we have extensive experience integrating payment processors, CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), email marketing platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo), analytics tools, social media APIs, shipping providers, accounting software, and custom enterprise systems. We also develop custom APIs and can connect your website to virtually any external service."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I choose Codebrand for web development?",
