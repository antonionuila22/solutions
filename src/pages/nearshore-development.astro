const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is nearshore software development?",
    answer: "Nearshore software development means partnering with a development team in a nearby country with similar timezones. For US companies, this typically means working with teams in Latin America (LATAM). Unlike offshore development (India, Eastern Europe), nearshore teams work during your business hours, enabling real-time collaboration, faster communication, and cultural alignment. You get the cost benefits of outsourcing without the timezone and communication challenges."
  },
  {
    question: "Why choose nearshore over offshore development?",
    answer: "Nearshore development offers three key advantages over offshore: (1) Timezone alignment—our team works US business hours (Central Time), so you get real-time collaboration instead of waiting 12+ hours for responses. (2) Cultural fit—Latin American business culture aligns closely with the US, making communication more natural and reducing misunderstandings. (3) Travel accessibility—if you ever need to meet in person, it's a short flight vs. 20+ hours to Asia. The cost savings are comparable to offshore, but the workflow is significantly smoother."
  },
  {
    question: "What timezone does your nearshore team work in?",
    answer: "Our team works US Central Time (CST/CDT), which overlaps with all US business hours. We're available 8 AM - 6 PM Central, which means full overlap with East Coast (9 AM - 7 PM ET) and significant overlap with West Coast (6 AM - 4 PM PT). This enables real-time Slack communication, live standups, and same-day code reviews—something impossible with offshore teams in drastically different timezones."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save with nearshore development?",
    answer: "Most clients save 50-60% compared to hiring US-based developers. A senior US developer costs $150,000-$200,000/year fully loaded (salary + benefits + equipment + overhead). Our nearshore rates of $45-95/hour translate to significant savings while maintaining the same quality standards. You also avoid recruitment costs, onboarding time, and the risk of a bad hire. Scale up or down as needed without long-term commitments."
  },
  {
    question: "Is your team fluent in English?",
    answer: "Yes, all our developers are fluent in English—both written and spoken. We communicate daily with US clients via Slack, Zoom, and written documentation. Our team members have worked with US companies for years and understand American business communication styles. No language barriers, no lost-in-translation moments. You'll feel like you're working with a local team."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies does your nearshore team specialize in?",
    answer: "We specialize in modern web technologies: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for frontend and full-stack development. For databases, we work with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. We're experienced with AWS, Vercel, and Netlify for deployment. For e-commerce, we build with Shopify (Liquid, Hydrogen) and headless commerce solutions. We adapt to your existing tech stack rather than forcing you to change."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure code quality in a nearshore setup?",
    answer: "Code quality is non-negotiable. Every pull request goes through peer review before merging. We use TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for consistency, and Prettier for formatting. We write unit tests for critical functionality and integration tests for APIs. Our CI/CD pipelines catch issues before they reach production. You receive clean, documented, maintainable code that your team can easily work with—the same standards as any top US agency."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can your nearshore team start on a project?",
    answer: "We can typically start within 1-2 weeks for most projects. For urgent needs, we have Rush availability that can begin same-day. Our process: (1) 30-minute discovery call to understand your needs, (2) proposal within 24 hours, (3) onboarding and tool setup within 2-3 days. We maintain bench capacity specifically to handle new client needs without long wait times."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between nearshore and onshore development?",
    answer: "Onshore means working with developers in your same country (US developers for US companies). Nearshore means nearby countries with similar timezones (LATAM for US). The main differences: (1) Cost—nearshore is typically 50-60% less expensive than onshore. (2) Talent pool—nearshore gives you access to a larger pool of skilled developers. (3) Scalability—easier to scale teams up/down with nearshore. Quality can be identical when you work with the right partner. We deliver the same standards as US agencies at a fraction of the cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you sign NDAs and protect intellectual property?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We sign NDAs before any project discussion and our contracts include strong IP protections. All code we write belongs to you—full ownership, no strings attached. We can work under your company's standard agreements if preferred. We also follow security best practices: encrypted communications, secure code repositories, and access controls. Your IP is protected."

                <strong class="text-white">Nearshore software development</strong> means partnering with a development team in a nearby country with similar timezones. For US companies, this typically means working with skilled teams in Latin America (LATAM)—countries like Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia.

                Unlike <strong class="text-white">offshore development</strong> (India, Philippines, Eastern Europe) where timezone differences create 12-24 hour communication delays, nearshore teams work during your business hours. You get real-time collaboration, live code reviews, and immediate responses—just like working with a local team.
