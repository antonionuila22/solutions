        question: "What's the minimum order?",
        answer: "There is no minimum—we're happy to do single items. That said, per-unit costs decrease with quantity. A single custom t-shirt might cost $25; 100 shirts might cost $8 each. We'll show you price breaks so you can decide what makes sense."
    },
    {
        question: "What file format do you need for my logo?",
        answer: "Ideally: vector files (AI, EPS, SVG, PDF). For simple printing, high-resolution PNG (300+ DPI) works too. Don't have vector files? We can often recreate your logo from a high-quality image—ask and we'll let you know."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between printing methods?",
        answer: "Screen printing: best for simple designs, 1-3 colors, large quantities. Sublimation: full-color, photographic quality, best on white/light polyester. Embroidery: premium look, durable, limited detail. Laser engraving: permanent, premium, works on hard materials. We recommend based on your design and product."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does production take?",
        answer: "Standard orders: 5-7 business days after proof approval. Rush orders: 2-3 business days (additional cost). Very large orders or custom products may take longer. We'll confirm timeline before you commit."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you match specific Pantone colors?",
        answer: "For screen printing and some products, yes—we can match Pantone colors. Sublimation and digital printing produce close matches but aren't exact Pantone. We'll advise on color accuracy for your specific order."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you ship internationally?",
        answer: "Yes. We ship throughout the US and internationally. International orders have longer transit times and may incur customs fees. We'll provide shipping quotes before you order."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I see a sample before ordering?",
        answer: "Yes. For larger orders, we recommend approving a physical sample first. Sample fees are typically waived for production orders. For smaller orders, digital proofs usually suffice, but samples are available if needed."
    },
    {
        question: "What about items not listed?",
        answer: "We can source almost any promotional product. If you have something specific in mind—whether it's branded golf balls, custom USB drives, or unique corporate gifts—just ask. We'll find it and quote it."
