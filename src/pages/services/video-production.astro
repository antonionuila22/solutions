        question: "Do you provide the filming or just editing?",

        question: "How long does a video project take?",
        answer: "Social media videos: 3-5 days. Promotional videos: 1-2 weeks. Full productions: 3-4 weeks. Timeline includes pre-production, filming (if needed), editing, and revisions. Rush turnarounds available for urgent projects at additional cost."
    },
    {
        question: "What equipment do you use?",
        answer: "Cinema cameras (Sony FX series, Blackmagic), professional lighting, wireless lavalier and shotgun microphones, stabilizers and sliders. We bring the right equipment for each project—studio interviews need different gear than outdoor events."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle music licensing?",
        answer: "Yes. We source music from licensed libraries (Artlist, Epidemic Sound) included in project cost. If you want a specific commercial song, we can research licensing costs—they vary widely depending on the track and usage."
    },
    {
        question: "What formats do you deliver?",
        answer: "Whatever you need. Standard delivery includes H.264 for web, ProRes for archiving, and platform-specific exports (16:9 for YouTube, 9:16 for TikTok/Reels, 1:1 for Instagram feed). Just tell us where the video will live."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you add subtitles/captions?",
        answer: "Absolutely—and you should. Most social video is watched without sound. We provide burned-in captions (always visible) or SRT files for platform captions. Professional captioning is included in our packages."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you travel for shoots?",
        answer: "Yes. We're based in the US but travel for projects. Travel costs (flights, hotels, per diem) are billed separately and discussed upfront. For straightforward projects, we can also direct remote shoots via video call."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from me to get started?",
        answer: "A brief: what's the video for, who's the audience, where will it be used, and any existing assets (footage, photos, logos). If we're filming, we'll need location details and talent availability. We'll guide you through everything else."
