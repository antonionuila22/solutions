    {
        question: "How long does it take to see SEO results?",
        answer: "SEO is a long-term investment. Most clients see meaningful improvement in 3-6 months, with significant results by 6-12 months. The timeline depends on your starting point, competition, and resources. We set realistic expectations upfront and show progress monthly—you'll see the needle moving before the big results hit."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you guarantee first page rankings?",
        answer: "No legitimate SEO professional can guarantee specific rankings—Google's algorithm is complex and constantly changing. What we can guarantee: we'll follow best practices, be transparent about our work, and show you measurable progress. If rankings and traffic aren't improving after 6 months, something's wrong."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you write content or just optimize existing pages?",
        answer: "Both. We audit and optimize your existing content first—often there are quick wins. For content gaps, we either write SEO-optimized content ourselves (included in higher packages or as an add-on) or provide detailed briefs for your team or writers to execute."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between SEO and paid ads?",
        answer: "Paid ads (Google Ads, Facebook) give instant traffic but stop when you stop paying. SEO takes longer but builds lasting organic traffic that continues without ongoing ad spend. Most businesses benefit from both—ads for immediate needs, SEO for long-term sustainable growth."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you track and report on progress?",
        answer: "We track keyword rankings weekly, organic traffic daily, and conversions continuously. Monthly reports show: ranking changes, traffic growth, top-performing pages, work completed, and next month's priorities. Reports are clear and actionable, not 50-page PDFs of vanity metrics."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with e-commerce sites?",
        answer: "Yes. E-commerce SEO has unique challenges: product pages, category structure, faceted navigation, seasonal products, and more. We've optimized Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom e-commerce platforms. Product schema, inventory management, and conversion optimization are all part of our approach."
    },
    {
        question: "What tools do you use?",
        answer: "We use professional tools including Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, Google Search Console, and Google Analytics. But tools are just tools—what matters is how we interpret the data and turn it into actionable strategy. We share relevant access so you can see what we see."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from us to get started?",
        answer: "We'll need: access to Google Search Console and Analytics (or help setting them up), access to your website CMS for making changes, and information about your business goals, target customers, and competitors. The first month is mostly us doing audits—minimal time required from you."

    "SEO is the process of making your website more visible in Google search results. When people search for what you offer, you want to appear on page one—because 90% of clicks go to the first page.",
    "Unlike paid ads, SEO builds lasting traffic. Once you rank, you get ongoing visitors without paying per click. It's an investment that compounds over time.",
    "We focus on three pillars: technical foundation (can Google crawl and index your site properly?), content (do you have pages that answer what people search?), and authority (do other sites trust and link to you?).",
    "SEO isn't about tricks or gaming the system—those tactics backfire. It's about making your site genuinely useful for searchers. Google wants to show the best results; we make sure your site qualifies.",
