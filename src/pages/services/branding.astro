        question: "How many logo concepts will I see?",
        answer: "Our standard packages include 3-5 initial concepts representing different creative directions. You'll choose one direction to refine, and we iterate from there. Most clients find their winner in the first round, but we keep exploring until you're confident in the choice."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does branding take?",
        answer: "A logo-only project takes 1-2 weeks. A complete brand identity takes 3-4 weeks. Full branding with strategy takes 6-8 weeks. Timeline depends on your feedback speed—we can move fast if you can. Rush options available for urgent projects."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don't like any of the initial concepts?",
        answer: "It rarely happens because we do discovery work upfront. But if it does, we dig into why, gather more direction, and create a new round of concepts. Our goal is your genuine excitement about your brand, and we'll keep working until we get there."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I own the final logo and brand assets?",
        answer: "Yes, 100%. Upon final payment, you receive full ownership of all deliverables. We don't retain any rights to use your brand—it's entirely yours. You'll get source files (Adobe Illustrator) so you or any designer can edit them in the future."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you match my existing brand colors/style?",
        answer: "Absolutely. If you have existing brand elements you want to keep, we incorporate them. Brand refreshes and extensions are common—updating a logo while maintaining color equity, or creating a sub-brand that connects to the parent. We'll respect what's working."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between a logo and a brand?",
        answer: "A logo is one element of a brand—like a face is one part of a person. A brand includes: visual identity (logo, colors, typography, imagery), messaging (voice, tone, key messages), and strategy (positioning, values, personality). The logo is important, but it's not the whole story."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you do brand naming?",
        answer: "Yes, though it's typically an add-on service. Brand naming involves brainstorming, trademark screening, domain availability checking, and linguistic testing. It's a significant undertaking—expect 2-3 weeks and additional cost. Happy to discuss if you need it."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from me to get started?",
        answer: "A brief about your business: what you do, who your customers are, who your competitors are, and any brands you admire (in or outside your industry). If you have existing materials or a previous logo, share those too. The more context, the better our starting point."

    "We don't follow trends blindly. Trendy logos feel dated in 3 years. We aim for timeless designs that stay relevant for a decade or more—think Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola.",
    "Branding isn't just for big companies. Small businesses benefit even more—consistent, professional branding makes you look established and trustworthy from day one.",
    "Good branding makes marketing easier. When your visual identity is defined and consistent, every piece of content, every ad, every email reinforces recognition.",
