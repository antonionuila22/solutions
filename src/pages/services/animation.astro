const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What's the difference between 2D and 3D animation?",
        answer: "2D animation is flat—like traditional cartoons or motion graphics. It's generally faster and more affordable. 3D animation has depth and dimension—think Pixar movies or product spins. 3D is more complex and costly but can achieve photorealism. We recommend based on your goals and budget."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does animation take?",
        answer: "Logo animations: 1 week. Motion graphics (30-60 sec): 2-3 weeks. Explainer videos: 4-6 weeks. 3D animation: 4-8 weeks depending on complexity. Animation is labor-intensive—every second of smooth motion takes significant work."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you write scripts for explainer videos?",
        answer: "Yes. For explainer videos, we typically write the script as part of the process. We research your product/service, identify key messages, and write a script that's engaging and the right length. You approve before we animate."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you match our brand style?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We design animations to extend your existing brand identity. Your colors, typography, and visual style inform the animation design. If you don't have established guidelines, we can develop an animation style that fits your brand personality."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide voiceover?",
        answer: "Yes. We work with professional voiceover artists in multiple languages and styles. You'll hear samples and approve the voice before recording. Voiceover is included in our Motion Graphics and Explainer packages."
    },
    {
        question: "What software do you use?",
        answer: "2D: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate. 3D: Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya. We deliver source files so you (or another designer) can make future edits."
    },
    {
        question: "Can animations be updated later?",
        answer: "Yes—that's a major advantage of animation. Text changes, color updates, new data—we can modify the animation without starting over. We provide source files, so you can also make simple updates yourself or have another team do it."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need to get started?",
        answer: "Your brand assets (logo, colors, fonts), information about what you want to explain or promote, and any examples of animation styles you like. For explainer videos, we'll also need product/service details for script writing."
