        question: "Do you post the content for us?",
        answer: "No—we focus on design only. We create the graphics and deliver them to you; you handle posting and scheduling. This keeps things simple and means we don't need access to your accounts. If you need full management, we can recommend partners."
    },
    {
        question: "What platforms do you design for?",
        answer: "Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube thumbnails—any major platform. Each has different dimensions and best practices, and we design accordingly. Just tell us where you're active."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you deliver the files?",
        answer: "We deliver via Google Drive, Dropbox, or your preferred platform. Files are organized by date or campaign, named clearly, and exported in the right formats for each platform. Some clients prefer direct upload to scheduling tools like Later or Buffer—we can accommodate that too."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I request specific post ideas or topics?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You can provide specific topics, campaigns, or promotions you want covered. Or you can give us general direction and we'll suggest content ideas. Most clients do a mix—some posts they direct, others they trust us to plan."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need something outside my monthly package?",
        answer: "We build flexibility into our process. Occasional extra posts are usually no problem. For consistently higher volume, we'd discuss moving to a larger package. Rush requests for time-sensitive content are accommodated when possible."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you write captions too?",
        answer: "Our Growth and Scale packages include caption suggestions. We're designers first, but we provide caption ideas and hashtag research to make posting easier. If you need professional copywriting, we can add that or recommend a content writer."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the revision process work?",
        answer: "After we deliver a batch of designs, you have time to review and request changes. Color tweaks, text edits, layout adjustments—we refine until you're happy. Most posts need zero or one revision because we nail the style early."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from us to start?",
        answer: "Your brand assets (logo, colors, fonts), examples of content you like, any existing brand guidelines, and context about your audience and goals. If you don't have formal guidelines, we'll work with what you have and develop a consistent style."
