const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What's the difference between UX and UI design?",
        answer: "UX (User Experience) design focuses on how a product works—the structure, flow, and functionality. It's about making things easy and intuitive. UI (User Interface) design focuses on how it looks—colors, typography, spacing, and visual polish. Great digital products need both: good UX with bad UI looks unprofessional; good UI with bad UX is frustrating to use."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with existing development teams?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Many clients have internal developers or work with dev agencies. We integrate into your workflow, use your preferred tools, and deliver in formats your team needs. We're also happy to collaborate directly with developers to ensure designs are implemented correctly."
    },
    {
        question: "What tools do you use?",
        answer: "We design primarily in Figma for its collaboration features and developer handoff capabilities. For prototyping, we use Figma's built-in prototyping or ProtoPie for more complex interactions. For research, we use tools like Hotjar, Google Analytics, and Maze for usability testing."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?",
        answer: "Yes, and we prefer it. Existing brand guidelines give us constraints that lead to better, more cohesive designs. We'll apply your colors, typography, and brand personality to create interfaces that feel distinctly yours."
    },
    {
        question: "How many revision rounds are included?",
        answer: "Our packages include 2-3 revision rounds, but honestly, we rarely need them all. We share work early and often, getting alignment throughout the process rather than revealing a big surprise at the end. That said, we'll keep refining until you're happy."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you design for both web and mobile apps?",
        answer: "Yes. We design responsive websites, web applications, iOS apps, and Android apps. Each platform has its own conventions and guidelines, and we design accordingly. If you need an app and website that feel connected, we ensure visual and interaction consistency across platforms."
    },
    {
        question: "What do I need to provide to get started?",
        answer: "Ideally: your brand guidelines (logo, colors, fonts), any existing design files, analytics access if available, and—most importantly—context about your users and business goals. If you don't have brand guidelines, we can work with what you have or help you develop them."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical UX/UI project take?",
        answer: "A UX audit takes 1-2 weeks. UI design for an existing product takes 2-4 weeks. A full UX/UI project with research takes 6-10 weeks depending on scope. We'll give you a specific timeline based on your project's complexity during our initial call."
