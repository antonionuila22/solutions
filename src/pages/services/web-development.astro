        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: "Most websites take 4-8 weeks from kickoff to launch. A simple 5-page site can be ready in 3-4 weeks, while complex e-commerce or web applications may take 8-12 weeks. We'll give you a specific timeline during our discovery call based on your project requirements."
    },
    {
        question: "What technologies do you use?",
        answer: "We primarily build with React, Next.js, and Astro for the frontend, with Node.js or serverless functions for backend needs. For e-commerce, we work with Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom solutions. We choose the right technology based on your specific needs, not just what's trendy."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide hosting?",
        answer: "We recommend and can set up hosting on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS—but you own the account. Hosting typically costs $0-20/month for most sites. We can also work with your existing hosting provider if you have one."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I update the content myself?",
        answer: "Absolutely. For most projects, we integrate a CMS (content management system) that lets you edit text, images, and add new pages without touching code. We provide training and documentation so you're comfortable making updates."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need changes after launch?",
        answer: "Your package includes a support period for minor fixes and adjustments. For ongoing updates, we offer monthly retainer plans starting at $500/month, or you can request changes on a project basis. Many clients choose the retainer for peace of mind."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with clients outside the US?",
        answer: "Yes, we work with clients worldwide. We're based in the US but have successfully delivered projects for clients in Latin America, Europe, and beyond. We adapt our communication schedule to work across time zones."
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from me to get started?",
        answer: "We'll need your brand assets (logo, colors, fonts), content for the site (or we can help you create it), and access to any existing accounts (domain registrar, current hosting, Google Analytics). Beyond that, just your time for feedback sessions and approvals."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not happy with the design?",
        answer: "We include multiple revision rounds in every project. We don't move to development until you approve the designs. If we're ever completely misaligned, we'll work together to find a solution or part ways professionally—but in 5+ years, that's never happened."
