const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What files do you need to start?",
        answer: "Ideally: CAD files (DWG, DXF), floor plans, elevations, and material specifications. For products: technical drawings, physical samples, or detailed photos from multiple angles. Don't have CAD? We can work from sketches, photos, and measurements—just takes a bit longer."
    },
    {
        question: "How realistic are the renders?",
        answer: "Very. We use physically-based rendering with accurate light simulation. Our renders are regularly mistaken for photographs. For real estate, clients often can't tell renders from photos of finished spaces."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does rendering take?",
        answer: "Single renders: 3-5 days. Visualization packages: 5-7 days. Complex projects: 2-3 weeks. Timeline depends on modeling complexity and revision cycles. Rush delivery available when you need it."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you match specific materials and finishes?",
        answer: "Yes. We work from material samples, manufacturer specifications, or reference photos. Flooring, countertops, fabrics, metals, wood grains—we match what you specify. We have extensive material libraries and create custom textures when needed."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you do architectural animations?",
        answer: "Yes—walkthroughs, flyovers, and animated sequences. Animation is priced separately based on length and complexity. The 3D model we create for stills can be animated without starting over."
    },
    {
        question: "What resolution do you deliver?",
        answer: "Standard delivery is 4K (3840x2160). We can render higher for large-format printing—8K or custom sizes as needed. We also provide web-optimized versions for online use."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you make changes after the render is done?",
        answer: "Usually yes, and that's a major advantage of 3D. Material changes, furniture swaps, and lighting adjustments are straightforward. Major structural changes may require additional modeling time. We include revision rounds in all packages."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with real estate developers?",
        answer: "Extensively. Pre-construction visualization is a significant part of our work. We understand marketing timelines, financing milestones, and what makes renders sell properties. Many clients work with us from land acquisition through project completion."
